Cleaning up the storages

Default storages are purged before the crawler starts if not specified otherwise. This happens as early as when we try to open some storage (e.g. via RequestQueue.open()) or when we try to work with a default storage via one of the helper methods (e.g. crawler.addRequests() that under the hood calls RequestQueue.open()). If we don't work with storages explicitly in our code, the purging will eventually happen when the run method of our crawler is executed. In case we need to purge the storages sooner, we can use the purgeDefaultStorages() helper explicitly:

import { purgeDefaultStorages } from 'crawlee';

await purgeDefaultStorages();

Calling this function will clean up the default request storage directory (and also the request list stored in default key-value store). This is a shortcut for running (optional) purge method on the StorageClient interface, in other words it will call the purge method of the underlying storage implementation we are currently using. You can make sure the storage is purged only once for a given execution context if you set onlyPurgeOnce to true in the options object.

Can it help?
